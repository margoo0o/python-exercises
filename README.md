# Python Exercises

Python Examples to work through - from Hello World to accessing APIs!
This is intended for everyone as an interactive workbook, but was primarily made for placement students to get to grips with the basics of Python.

> **_NOTE_**: Windows/Mac or Linux can be used for this, but Python 3 is recommended. In terms of your IDE, Visual Studio Code works a treat, but PyCharm community edition is equally as good (and both are free!)

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3) - make sure you include pip in the install.
    * pip is the package installer for Python. We can write a lot with basic Python, but it's useful to use packages that other people have written. That way we don't have to write everything from scratch ourselves.
 2. Double check python has installed successfully. In a terminal, type in `python --version`.
    * If that doesn't work, try `python3 --version`. You should see a version number output e.g. `Python 3.10.8`.
 3. Install and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
 4. Open the `python_demo` folder in VS Code.
 5. Click on `Terminal` in the taskbar, then `New Terminal`. In that terminal, type in the following command: `pip install requests`.

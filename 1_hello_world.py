# Welcome to your first Python program! 👋🏻
# For a lot of programming languages, the very first program a 
# developer will make is called "Hello World". It lets us know 
# everything is working as expected. We usually do that by printing "Hello World".
print("Hello World!")

# In Python we can use variables. In code, a variable holds some bit of data. It can
# be a string (characters in quotes), integers aka ints (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers)
# and a whole bunch of other things!
